# ImageEncryptionSystem
Project for COMP6841 Cyber Security 'Something Awesome' project.

Possible name: A Picture tells 2^x words

For this project, I have designed an encryption system built on writing encoded messages into images.
This consists of both an encryption function as well as the corresponding decryption function. 

While I am very confident I can successfully develop a basic model of this system, the main goals I
have will be in its;

1) efficiency: how much data can be stored and how minimal can the distortion be  
2) security: how secure can this system be to prevent attacker's extracting the message without the decryption algorithm via brute force or otherwise.
